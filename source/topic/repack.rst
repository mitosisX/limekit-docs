Insight Into Pack Command
=========================

.. highlight:: console

.. program:: pyarmor gen

Pyarmor 8.0 has no command pack, but :option:`--pack`. It could specify an executable file generated by PyInstaller_::

  pyinstaller foo.py
  pyarmor gen --pack dist/foo/foo foo.py

If no options are set, pyarmor only obfuscates the scripts.

If this option is set, pyarmor first obfuscates the scripts, then does extra work:

* Unpacking this executable to a temporary folder
* Replacing the scripts in bundle with obfuscated ones
* Appending runtime files to the bundle in this temporary folder
* Repacking this temporary folder to an executable file and overwrite the old

Note that only list scripts are obfuscated, if need obfuscate more scripts and sub packages, list all of them in command line. For example::

  pyarmor gen --pack dist/foo/foo -r *.py dir1 dir2 ...

In Darwin, let obfuscated scripts work in both intel and Apple Silicon by extra option ``--platform darwin.x86_64,darwin.arm64`::

  pyarmor gen --pack dist/foo/foo --platform darwin.x86_64,darwin.arm64 foo.py

Packing obfuscated scripts manually
===================================

If something is wrong with :option:`--pack`, or the final bundle doesn't work, try to pack the obfuscated scripts manually.

You need to know how to `using PyInstaller`__ and `using spec file`__, if not, learn it by yourself.

__ https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/usage.html
__ https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/spec-files.html

Here is an example to pack script ``foo.py`` in the path ``/path/to/src``

* First obfuscating the script by Pyarmor [#]_::

    cd /path/to/src
    pyarmor gen -O obfdist -a foo.py

* Moving runtime package to current path [#]_::

    mv obfdist/pyarmor_runtime_000000 ./

* Already have ``foo.spec``, appending runtime package to ``hiddenimports``

.. code-block:: python

    a = Analysis(
        ...
        hiddenimports=['pyarmor_runtime_000000'],
        ...
    )

* Otherwise generating ``foo.spec`` by PyInstaller [#]_::

    pyi-makespec --hidden-import pyarmor_runtime_000000 foo.py

* Patching ``foo.spec`` by inserting extra code after ``a = Analysis``

.. code-block:: python

    a = Analysis(
        ...
        hiddenimports=['pyarmor_runtime_000000'],
        ...
    )

    # Pyarmor patch start:

    def pyarmor_patcher(src, obfdist):
        # Make sure both of them are absolute paths
        src = os.path.abspath(src)
        obfdist = os.path.abspath(obfdist)

        count = 0
        for i in range(len(a.scripts)):
            if a.scripts[i][1].startswith(src):
                x = a.scripts[i][1].replace(src, obfdist)
                if os.path.exists(x):
                    a.scripts[i] = a.scripts[i][0], x, a.scripts[i][2]
                    count += 1
        if count == 0:
            raise RuntimeError('No obfuscated script found')

        for i in range(len(a.pure)):
            if a.pure[i][1].startswith(src):
                x = a.pure[i][1].replace(src, obfdist)
                if os.path.exists(x):
                    if hasattr(a.pure, '_code_cache'):
                        with open(x) as f:
                            a.pure._code_cache[a.pure[i][0]] = compile(f.read(), a.pure[i][1], 'exec')
                    a.pure[i] = a.pure[i][0], x, a.pure[i][2]

    pyarmor_patcher(r'/path/to/src', r'/path/to/obfdist')

    # Pyarmor patch end.

    pyz = PYZ(a.pure, a.zipped_data, cipher=block_cipher)

* Generating final bundle by this patched ``foo.spec``, also use option `--clean` to to remove all cached files::

    pyinstaller --clean foo.spec

If following this example, please

* Replacing all the ``/path/to/src`` and ``/path/to/obfdist`` with actual path
* Replacing all the ``pyarmor_runtime_000000`` with actual name

**how to verify obfuscated scripts have been packed**

Inserting some print statements in the ``foo.spec`` to print which script is replaced, or add some code only works in the obfuscated script.

For example, add one line in the main script ``foo.py``

.. code-block:: python

    print('this is __pyarmor__', __pyarmor__)

If it's not obfuscated, the final bundle will raise error.

.. rubric:: notes

.. [#] Do not use :option:`-i` and :option:`--prefix` to obfuscate the scripts
.. [#] Just let PyInstaller could find runtime package without extra pypath
.. [#] Most of the other PyInstaller options could be used here

Segment fault in Apple M1
=========================

In Apple M1 if the final executable segment fault, please check codesign of runtime package::

    $ codesign -v dist/foo/pyarmor_runtime_000000/pyarmor_runtime.so

And re-sign it if the code sign is invalid::

    $ codesign -f -s dist/foo/pyarmor_runtime_000000/pyarmor_runtime.so

If you use :option:`--enable-bcc` or :option:`--enable-jit` to obfuscate the scripts, you need enable `Allow Execution of JIT-compiled Code Entitlement`__

If your app doesn’t have the new signature format, or is missing the DER entitlements in the signature, you’ll need to re-sign the app on a Mac running macOS 11 or later, which includes the DER encoding by default.

If you’re unable to use macOS 11 or later to re-sign your app, you can re-sign it from the command-line in macOS 10.14 and later. To do so, use the following command to re-sign the MyApp.app app bundle with DER entitlements by using a signing identity named "Your Codesign Identity" stored in the keychain::

    $ codesign -s "Your Codesign Identity" -f --preserve-metadata --generate-entitlement-der /path/to/MyApp.app
