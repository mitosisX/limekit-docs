Let's get you started!
==================================

*Limekit* is a framework for building desktop applications using the `lua <https://www.lua.org/>`_ language without the need for HTML and CSS. The framework allows developers to maintain one lua codebase and create cross-platform apps that work on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

.. note::
   The framework is being developed in `python <https://www.python.org/>`_, but you don't have to learn python at all.

.. important::

   This is a test release, and intentionally lacks many features and properties. 

   Currently, only Windows and Linux are supported. MacOS support coming soon

* :doc:`Part 1: Setup <getting-started>` takes you by the hand through a series of steps to setup python on your computer. This is the most crucial part as the framework relies on the python language.

* :doc:`Part 2: Using Widgets </widgets>` This part focuses on interactivity. Think buttons, combo boxes, menus, check boxes, radio buttons and many more - they're all in the mix!

* :doc:`Part 3: Layout Managers </layouts>` This part shows you how to make the most of the utilities in the framework and all the extra goodies that come with it!

* :doc:`Part 3: App utilities </app-utils>` This part shows you how to make the most of the utilities in the framework and all the extra goodies that come with it!
