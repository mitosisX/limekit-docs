Let's get you started!
==================================

*Limekit* is a framework for building desktop applications using the `lua <https://www.lua.org/>`_ language without the need for HTML and CSS. The framework allows developers to maintain single lua codebase and create cross-platform apps that work on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

.. note::

   The framework is being created in `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_, but there's no need for you to learn Python at all.

.. important::

   This is a test release deliberately lacking numerous features and properties.
   
   Presently, it only supports Windows and Linux, with MacOS support arriving soon.

* :doc:`Part 1: Setup <getting-started>`: Guides you step-by-step to set up Python on your computer, which is crucial as the framework depends on the Python language.

* :doc:`Part 2: Widgets </widgets>`: Focuses on interactivity. Think buttons, combo boxes, menus, check boxes, radio buttons and many more - they're all in the mix!

* :doc:`Part 3: Widget Items </widget-items>`: Covers how to interact with some special widgets such as the Tab, ToolBar, etc.

* :doc:`Part 4: Layout Managers</widgets>`: Covers the different layouts available in the framework

* :doc:`Part 5: App object </app-object>`: Shows you how to make the most of the utilities in the framework and all the extra goodies that come with it!

* :doc:`Part 6: User resources </user-resources>`: Shows you how to make the most of the utilities in the framework and all the extra goodies that come with it!

* :doc:`Part 7: Batteries included </batteries>`: Covers all the other features provided by the framework, such as the sqlite3 database, using the system tray, displaying system notifications, threads, signals, and many more.
