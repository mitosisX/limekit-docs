Widgets
========

Widgets are graphical elements or components that make up the user interface of an application. They can be buttons, text boxes, labels, windows, checkboxes, sliders, and more. These widgets allow users to interact with the program by providing input, displaying information, or triggering specific actions. This framework provides a wide range of widgets that can be arranged to create a functional and visually appealing user interface.

Presently, there are :mod:`35` widgets at your disposal within the framework. Considering the framework is new, the count is subject to change. Anticipate additional widgets as the framework evolves.
