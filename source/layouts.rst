Layout Managers
==================

Layouts are structures used to arrange and manage the positioning of widgets within a graphical user interface. They define the organization and alignment of various elements such as buttons, input fields, labels, and other widgets within a window. Layouts help ensure that the components within an application are positioned correctly and adjust dynamically when the window is resized or modified, aiding in the creation of visually consistent and responsive user interfaces. Some common layouts in layouts in Limekit are listed below, each serving different purposes in organizing the visual elements of an application.
