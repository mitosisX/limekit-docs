Introduction
============

This documentation is only apply to Pyarmor_ 8.0 plus.

Pyarmor is published as shareware, free trial version never expires, but there are some limitations:

(1) Can not obfuscate big scripts
(2) Can not use feature mix-str to obfuscate string constant in scripts
(3) Can not use RFT Mode, BCC Mode
(4) Can not be used for any commercial product if the total sale income of this product is larger than 30x license fees
(5) Can not change runtime package name "pyarmor_runtime_000000"
(6) Can not be used to provide obfuscation service in any form
(7) Can not use obf-code > 1

These limitations can be unlocked by different License Types except last one.

License types
=============

Pyarmor has 3 kind of licenses:

.. glossary::

    Pyarmor Basic

        Basic license could unlock limitations (1) (2) (4) (5) (7).

        Each obfuscation need online verify license.

    Pyarmor Pro

        Pro license could unlock limitations (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (7).

        Each obfuscation need online verify license.

    Pyarmor Group

        Group license could unlock limitations (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (7).

        Group license supports unlimited dockers which uses default bridge network and not highly customized. For Pyarmor Basic or Pyarmor Pro, up to 100 runs in 24 hours.

        Offline obfuscation, it need not internet connection when obfuscating the scripts.

**For Pyarmor Basic and Pro License, only Pyarmor License file, serial number of hard disk, Ethernet address, IPv4/IPv6 address, and hostname will be sent to remote server for verification. No any user script will be uploaded to remote server**

**Group license is bind to device hardwares, it may not work in any device which hardwares are volatile (docker container is OK only if group license works in docker host)**

**Pyarmor License is only applicable to build machines which are used to obfuscate scripts, it has no any limitation for target machines in which to run the obfuscated scripts**

Each license has an unique number, the format is ``pyarmor-vax-xxxxxx``, which x stands for a digital.

Each product requires one License No. So any product in global also has an unique number in Pyarmor world.

**License No. and product name will be embedded into obfuscated scripts, all the other user's information, for example, regname, email are not**

If user has many products, and has purchased one license for the first product. The second product could use first product license only if sale income of the second product less than 30x license fees. Once greater than 30x license fees, the second product need purchase its own license. It's same to user's other products.

One product in Pyarmor world means a product name and everything that makes up this name.

It includes all the devices to develop, build, debug, test product.

It also includes product current version, history versions and all the future versions.

One product may has several variants, each variant name is composed of product name plus feature name. As long as the proportion of the variable part is far less than that of the common part, they're considered as "one product".

Pyarmor License could be installed in many machines and devices which belong to licensed product. But there is limitation to be used at the same time.

In 24 hours only less than 100 devices can use one same Pyarmor License. Pyarmor License be used means use any feature of Pyarmor in one machine. Running obfuscated scripts generated by Pyarmor is not considered as Pyarmor License be used.

.. seealso:: `Pyarmor EULA`_, :doc:`Using Pyarmor Licenses <how-to/register>`

**What's one product**

First of all, if not for sale, all the Python scripts are belong to one product "non-profits".

Pyarmor is one product, it includes:

* Pyarmor basic, Pyarmor pro, and Pyarmor group
* pyarmor-webui which provides graphics interface for pyarmor.
* the order system of Pyarmor is a Django's app running in cloud-server. This Django's app also belongs to one product Pyarmor.
* the laptop used to develop Pyarmor, the PCs used to test Pyarmor, the cloud-server to serve order system of Pyarmor, all of them belong to one product Pyarmor.
* Pyarmor 7.x, Pyarmor 8.x and Pyarmor 9.x

Microsoft Office is not one product, because each product in Microsoft Office is functional independence. For example, Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel belong to Microsoft Office, but they're totally different.

Microsoft Word is one product, and Microsoft Word 2003ï¼ŒWord 2007 etc. are belong to one product Microsoft word.

**Hints for Pyarmor licenses**

- Basic, Pro and Group license Only work for Python 3.7+ in supported platforms. If using Python 2.7 or prior to 3.7, only Pyarmor old license works.
- If need generate obfuscated scripts offline, only Pyarmor Group or Pyarmor old license works
- Pyarmor Basic and Pro license need internet connection to verify license when obfuscating the scripts, and in 24 hours only 100 different devices are allowed to obfuscate the scripts for each license.
- In 24 hours, if need more than 100 docker containers to obfuscate your scripts, only Pyarmor Group or Pyarmor old license works.
- Pyarmor Basic, Pro and Group licenses don't work for Pyarmor 7.

Check device for group license
------------------------------

Check one device works for group license by this way:

* First install Pyarmor 8.4.0+ trial version in this device
* Got machine id by the following command::

    $ pyarmor reg -g 101
    ...
    INFO     current machine id is "mc92c9f22c732b482fb485aad31d789f1"
    INFO     device file has been generated successfully

* Reboot this device, check machine id is same or not
* If machine id is same after each reboot, group license works in this device. Otherwise group license doesn't work in this device.

For docker container, please check docker host as above. Only if docker host could work with group license, unlimited docker containers could be run in this docker host, refer to :doc:`how-to/register` section ``run unlimited dockers in offline device``

**If machine id of docker host is changed after reboot, group license doesn't work in any docker container**

Most of local machine, cloud server or VM like qemu, virtual box, vmware with same disk image work with Group license. If using group in CI pipeline, the default runner doesn't work, but something like `self-host runner`__ may work.

.. _upgrading old license:

Upgrading old license
=====================

Not all the old license could be upgraded to latest version.

The old license could be upgraded to Pyarmor Basic freely only if it matches these conditions:

* Following new `Pyarmor EULA`_
* The license no. starts with ``pyarmor-vax-``
* The original activation file ``pyarmor-regcode-xxxx.txt`` exists and isn't used more than 100 times
* The old license is purchased before June 1, 2023. In principle, the old license purchased after Pyarmor 8 is available could not be upgraded to new license.

If failed to upgrade the old license, please purchase new license to use Pyarmor latest version.

The old license can't be upgraded to Pyarmor Pro and Group.

..
  But there is discount for old users to purchase Pyarmor Pro.

       -

  Please send your order no. to pyarmor@163.com to request discount coupon, this request must be sent from registration email.

Upgrading old license to Pyarmor Basic
--------------------------------------

First find the activation file ``pyarmor-regcode-xxxx.txt``, which is sent to registration email when purchasing the license.

Next install Pyarmor 8.2+, according to new `EULA of Pyarmor`_, each license is only for one product.

Assume this license will be used to obfuscate product ``XXX``, run this command::

    $ pyarmor reg -u -p "XXX" pyarmor-regcode-xxxx.txt

Check the upgraded license information::

    $ pyarmor -v

After upgrade successfully, do not use activation file ``pyarmor-regcode-xxxx.txt`` again, it's invalid now. A new :term:`registration file` like :file:`pyarmor-regfile-xxxx.zip` will be generated at the same time.

In other devices using this new :term:`registration file` to register Pyarmor by this command::

    $ pyarmor reg pyarmor-regfile-xxxx.zip

After successful registration, all obfuscations will automatically apply this license, and each obfuscation requires online license verification.

If old license is used by many products (mainly old personal license), only one product could be used after upgrading. For the others, it need purchase new license.

..
  Upgrading old license to Pyarmor Pro
  ------------------------------------

  Upgrading old license to Pyarmor Pro needs extra fees.

  If you have Pyarmor 8.2+ installed, this command also could open shopping cart::

      $ pyarmor reg --buy

  In the shopping cart, select ``Pyarmor-upgrade`` and complete the payment online.

  A file named ``pyarmor-regcode-to-pro.txt`` will be sent by email immediately after payment is completed successfully.

  This file includes the guide  to upgrade old license to Pyarmor Pro.

  Internet connection and Pyarmor 8.2+ are required to upgrade old license, check Pyarmor version by this command

      pyarmor -v

  Check old license

      pyarmor-7 -v

  If no old license found, register old license first

      pyarmor-7 register pyarmor-regcode-xxxx.txt

  Assume this license will be used to obfuscate product ``XXX``, run this command::

      $ pyarmor reg -u -p "XXX" pyarmor-regcode-xxxx.txt

  Check the upgraded license information::

      $ pyarmor -v

  After upgrade successfully, the file ``pyarmor-regcode-to-pro.txt`` is invalid. A new :term:`registration file` like :file:`pyarmor-regfile-xxxx.zip` will be generated at the same time.

  In other devices using this new :term:`registration file` to register Pyarmor by this command::

      $ pyarmor reg pyarmor-regfile-xxxx.zip

  After successful registration, all obfuscations will automatically apply this license, and each obfuscation requires online license verification.

  If old license is used by many products (mainly old personal license), only one product could be used after upgrading. For the others, it need purchase new license.
